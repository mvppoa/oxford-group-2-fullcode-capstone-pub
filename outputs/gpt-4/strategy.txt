Rolls-Royce's strategy for their Small Modular Reactor (SMR) involves the development of a low-cost, clean energy solution, backed by the UK Government's financial support. The design work for the SMR began around 2015 with a team of approximately 150 people. They utilize proven technology and light water for both the coolant and moderator. Each SMR unit is expected to deliver stable, affordable, and emission-free energy for at least 60 years, sufficient to power a million homes.

The SMRs are designed to be fully integrated and factory-built, reducing site construction activities and confined to the compact size of previous nuclear or coal-fired power stations in Northern England. The proposed cost for each of these units would be around £1.8 billion, or £3.3 billion per GW, cheaper and quicker to build compared to larger nuclear plants.

Furthermore, Rolls-Royce has received significant government backing for their SMRs, including £56 million funding over three years to support research and development. The company intends to build 16 mini-nuclear plants across the UK, enabling decarbonisation and creating jobs. Rolls-Royce's SMR strategy highlights their efforts to drive innovation in nuclear energy development, underscoring its potential to address clean and affordable energy demands.
